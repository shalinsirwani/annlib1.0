Follow the steps in order to use this program to create your own Neural Network in C++
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Installation for Interface@1
	----------------------------
	
	for Ubuntu (14 , 16 , 18)

	1) Download this git 
	
	2) Unzip it

	3) Now compile first train module(nn_f_t) , continue training module(nn_f_c) , prediction module (nn_f_p) by opening these modules in terminal type "make" for each module.

	4) Now as binaries are available to pass your topology , learningRate , momentum , bias , epoch , trainingData , weightsFile , hiddenactivationtype , outputactivationtype , costfunctiontype use only config.json or pconfig.json files (****do not edit any of the source files**** by the way you may do this if you understand it. Its totally free source :).

	5) Now to see your configured Artifical Neural Network in action just type "./output" form your respective module (train module(nn_f_t) , continue training module(nn_f_c) , prediction module (nn_f_p)).

	6) For further understanding , in short span of time , i would create a tutorials "about how to use this program just by editing config files".

	Installation for Interface@2
	----------------------------
	
	for Ubuntu (14 , 16 , 18)

	1) Download this git 
	
	2) Unzip it

	3) Now open first train module(nn_f_t) , continue training module(nn_f_c) , prediction module (nn_f_p) by opening these modules in terminal type "make please" for each module.

	4) Now you got a main binary file simply run it by typing "./main".

	5) You can also pass your topology , learningRate , momentum , bias , epoch , trainingData , weightsFile , hiddenactivationtype , outputactivationtype , costfunctiontype use only config.json or pconfig.json files (****do not edit any file in lib and include folder**** by the way you may do this if you understand it. Its totally free source :).

	6) For further understanding , in short span of time , i would create a tutorials "about how to use this program just by editing config files". 

		Thats it ....... have a nice day.
